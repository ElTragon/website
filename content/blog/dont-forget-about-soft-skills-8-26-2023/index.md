# Don't be weird

Recently I landed a new job at [molecular testing labs](url) as a developer. I was able to get this role mainly do my people skills, we even skipped the technical interviews. While this sounds strange to some people, keep in mind the hiring team is just looking for someone the development team can work with for 40 hours a week. If you can pass the vibe test, then they are more likely to hire you. When I began my career in tech I initially focused too much on the technical side of the field. How do I reverse a linked-list, should I use a resurseon or dynamic programing for this problem? Sadly for my people skills are not as strong as they soon be, so I just down plaied their importance for landing jobs.

# Small talk matters

We all had those talks with recuiters, they need a moment to get ready for the interview. They pull up your resume, send off some quick email, get their notepad ready. All the while they are asking you about your day. These moments matter, it's the first impression you are giving them. You need to ask these questions and ask some back. Bonus points if you can ask about thing you really care about. So stalk them on socail media and talk about something you have in common. Ask follow up questions about the things they say.

We have all talked to people and gotten the vibe that they are only waiting to say the thing they have in mind, being a good concerstipnest doesn't mean you need to say a lot. Keep it simple and listen to the other person and ask questions about what they said

# Answer the questions

All interviews are different, this is why you need to answer the question asked. If ask you your work history just say the minimunm Ex. "I began my career at Company A as a intern web dev, then I moved on to Company B as entry Enginner, and finally when to Company C as a Software Engineer. Let me know if you want me to go more in detail on anything I said"
The recuiter might be reading your resume and this question might just be there to give them time. Maybe they want to know about why you left Company A or what tools you used at each company. So keep your answers brief when the questions are more ambiuous and give more details when the questions ask for it.




# Recap
- Algorithms are not measured in speed
- Algorithms are measured in growth
- Algorithms times are written in Big O notation
- Big O runtime is always the worst-case

As people start their software engineering career, many forget how important the soft skills are. I have spent countless hours on leetcode preparing for interviews, but I overlooked how to communicate effectively. For some this comes easliy, if you are like me then you need to work on it. Learn how to small talk, learn to answer questions, and learn to write.
