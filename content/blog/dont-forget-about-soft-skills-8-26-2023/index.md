# Don't be weird

![bigOChar](./doNotBeWeird.png)

Recently I landed a new job at [Molecular testing labs](https://moleculartestinglabs.com/) as a developer. I landed this role mainly do my people skills, we even skipped the technical interviews. While this sounds weird, keep in mind the hiring team is just looking for someone the development team can work with for 40 hours a week. If you can pass the vibe test, then they are more likely to hire you. When I began my career in tech I initially focused too much on the technical side of the field. How do I reverse a linked-list, should I use a recursion or dynamic programming for this problem? Sadly my people skills are not as strong as they soon be, so I just down played their importance for landing jobs.

# Small talk matters

We all had those talks with recruiters, they need a moment to get ready for the interview. They pull up your resume, send off some quick email, get a notepad ready. All the while they are asking you about your day. These moments matter, it's the first impression you are giving them. You need to answer these questions and ask some back. Bonus points if you can ask about something you really care about. So stalk them on social media and talk about something you have in common. Ask follow up questions about the things they say.

We have all talked to people and gotten the vibe that they are only waiting to say the thing they have in mind, being a good conservationist doesn't mean you need to say a lot. Keep it simple and listen to the other person and ask questions about what they said.

# Answer the questions

All interviews are different, this is why you need to answer the question asked. If asked about your work history just say the minimum. For example, "I began my career at Company A as a intern web dev, then I moved on to Company B as Entry level Engineer, and finally when to Company C as a Software Engineer. Would you me to go more in detail any anything specifically." The recruiter might be reading your resume and this question might just be there to give them time. Maybe they want to know about why you left Company A or what tools you used at each company. So keep your answers brief when the questions are more ambiguous and give more details when the questions ask for it.

# Ask questions too

Remember companies want to get the feel that you want to work for them too. Whether or nor you're looking for the perfect job or any job to pay your bills, companies want to get the impression that you are not just getting the job till you land a better offer and leave the first chance you got. So you need to ask question that show that you want the job and did your homework. For example "What does growth and development look at Company A" or "What attracted you to this company and was it what you expected?". If possible you can ask the person interviewing you what they are looking for in the perfect candidate. You can use this information to help you answer future questions.

# Know your audience

Keep in mind all interviews are different. Some interviewers have a list of questions they need to get thru so the higher ups can review your answers. Some interviewers want a two-way conversation where you and the interviewer are working thru a problem so they can see how you work with others. Sometimes it's just a technical timed question or a vibe check. So whenever possible ask how you can prepare for the interview and what you should expect.

# Recap

- Don't be weird
- Small talk if possible
- Listen and answer what they asked
- Ask questions, if possible ask questions about they said
- Do your homework

Lastly be relaxed, remember you are applying because you are the solution to the problems they are facing. Remember to show this and that it would be a pleasure to work with you. Also if they ask a tough question, pretend to take a sip of coffee or ask them to repeat themselves on zoom to give you more time to think of a answer.
